## Requirements

- There are two views: "My Tasks" for all open tasks and "Archive" for completed tasks
- The name of the active view is highlighted
- Responsive design

### My tasks

- Adding a task
- The headline above the task items contains the number of visible open tasks
- The user can type in a search value which filters the list of open tasks
- The user sees all open tasks in cards
- Instead of an empty tasks list, the text "No tasks available" appears when all tasks are done
- When a user activates a checkbox, the task should immediately be removed from the open
  tasks list and should be visible on the Archive view

### Archive

- The headline above the task items contains the number of visible completed tasks

- The user sees all completed tasks in cards
- When a user de-selects a checkbox, the task should immediately be removed from the
